### 🚀 Who am I?

I am a **Security Analyst** bridging the gap between Governance (GRC) and Technical Operations. My background as a **Developer** allows me to look at code and infrastructure not just as checklists, but as living systems with behaviors to be analyzed.

Currently, I leverage my experience implementing **ISO 27001/27701** to understand *what* needs protecting, while using my technical skills to figure out *how* attackers might bypass those protections.

### 🎯 Current Focus & Objectives

I am transitioning my career towards **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** and **Threat Hunting**. I have a deep passion for the investigative side of security—connecting dots, analyzing malware behavior, and understanding the human element through Social Engineering.

* 🔭 **I’m currently studying:** OSINT Techniques, Zero Trust Architecture, and Malware Analysis.
* 📝 **I write about:** Malware cases and security insights on [Medium](https://medium.com/@eduardoferreira.ti).
* 🧠 **My mindset:** "Assume Breach" & "Never Trust, Always Verify".
